Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident
Issue Summary:
Duration: Start Time - 2023-05-13 1:00 PM (EAT), End Time - 2023-05-13 2:30 PM (EAT)
Impact: The web application service experienced a complete outage during the incident, resulting in a total loss of service for all users. Approximately 100% of the users were affected by the outage.
Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfigured load balancer, which led to improper routing of incoming requests to the application servers.
Timeline:
2023-05-13 1:00 PM (EAT): The outage was detected when monitoring systems indicated a sudden drop in incoming traffic and a significant increase in error rates.
An engineer noticed the abnormal patterns and alerted the operations team about the issue.
Actions were taken to investigate the cause of the issue. The investigation initially focused on the application servers, network connectivity, and database servers.
Misleading paths were taken during the initial investigation, including checking the database for potential performance issues and reviewing recent code deployments.
As the investigation progressed, it was realized that the load balancer configuration might be the culprit behind the routing problem.
The incident was escalated to the network engineering team to review the load balancer configuration.
The misconfigured load balancer was identified and rectified.
The incident was resolved by reconfiguring the load balancer to ensure proper routing of incoming requests.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was determined to be a misconfigured load balancer. The misconfiguration caused incoming requests to be improperly routed, resulting in the application servers not receiving any traffic.
Resolution: The misconfigured load balancer was reconfigured to ensure correct routing of incoming requests. The necessary adjustments were made to the load balancing algorithm and backend server configuration to restore proper functionality.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:
Enhance load balancer configuration management processes to prevent misconfigurations.
Implement regular load balancer health checks and monitoring to detect configuration issues promptly.
Establish automated tests for load balancer configurations during deployment pipelines.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Conduct a comprehensive review of the load balancer configurations across the entire infrastructure.
Implement stricter change management processes to ensure thorough testing and validation of load balancer changes.
Enhance monitoring systems to provide real-time visibility into load balancer performance and configuration status.
Develop a playbook for troubleshooting load balancer-related issues and train the operations team on its usage.
Conduct post-incident reviews with the engineering and operations teams to share lessons learned and identify areas for improvement.
By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to enhance the stability and reliability of the web application service, minimize the occurrence of similar incidents, and improve our incident response capabilities.
This postmortem provides a detailed analysis of the web stack outage incident, including the impact, root cause, timeline, resolution, and recommendations for improvement. We are committed to learning from this incident and taking proactive steps to ensure a more robust and resilient infrastructure in the future.
